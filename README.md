The project replicates the design of the following website: http://zakazaka.ru using the latest version of Twitter Bootstrap + Sass + jQuery. 

<b>Main page:</b> index.html

<b>Restaurants list:</b> restaurants.html

<b>Checkout empty:</b> empty-cart.html

Setup:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:kotapaulta/zakazaka-replica.git
$ cd zakazaka-replica
$ bower install
```

All Css and Js files must be maintainable, understandable and concise with short comments if needed. All variables in Sass should be either named appropriately or commented. All the JS components, including carousels, modals, dropdowns, and etc should be working correctly. Font Awesome should be used for icons.

Shadows, textures, and borders has to be implemented as well. 

Web pages needed to be replicated:

1) Main page (http://zakazaka.ru): 
When client logged in, appropriate info should be displayed in the subheader. Dropdown menu should work with user profile to prompt user to do some actions. Modals for "login/register" and "contact us" sections should be implemented.

2) Restaurants list (http://zakazaka.ru/restaurants):
Restaurant logo should have an ability to include a label (like those with "The Best" label). Should not be hardcoded, but written in CSS. 

3) Single restaurant (http://zakazaka.ru/restaurants/menu/toropizza):
The list of menus on the left should be floating. Shopping cart should appear at the bottom.

4) Checkout page (http://zakazaka.ru/cart.htm - there should be some items in the shopping cart):
No specific preferences.

The design throughout the pages should be consistent although doesn't have to be 100% as the original site. For instance, that oddly shaped container of login/register and checkout form modal could be a bit simpler.
